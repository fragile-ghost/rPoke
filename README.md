Ever wanted to randomize every part of a pokemon? Moves, stats, IVs, EVs, and even held item?

The file will not work on its own, but provides a class that will do essentially everything you need. Use .pokepaste() to return a pokepaste string to use on Showdown!

Credit to Pokemon Showdown for the data included in the repository. Slight editing was done to make all of them .json files.
